### My two cents so far (Updated 09/10/2019)

This tutorial is alright, but probably not a great one for beginners.

<u>Pros:</u>

1. With the help of Bulma-Rails (a gem), you don't have to worry about styling of the blog (The only thing you need to do is simply importing 'Bulma' in your scss file).

<u>Cons:</u>

1.	The good thing is also the bad thing. As he used heaps functionalities from Bulma-Rails to create forms, you wouldn’t know how to create forms properly from scratch. 

2. Initially, he didn't install some Ruby gems correctly, so you would need to go back to fix some issues there (Took me about 15-20mins to fix them. Would be nice if he could have edited that part of the video.)

3. He didn't explain some code clearly… but probably that’s how Rails magic works? lol
