### My two cents

This tutorial is not bad, but probably not a great one for beginners:

:+1: <b>Pros:</b>

1. It's a FREE 1-hr tutorial on YouTube!

2. With the help of Bulma-Rails (a gem), you don't have to worry about styling of the blog (the only thing you need to do is simply importing 'Bulma' in your scss file).

3. You can build a functional blog site after following through.

:-1: <b>Cons:</b>

1.	The good thing is also the bad thing. As the tutor used heaps functionalities from Bulma-Rails & Simple Form (another gem) to create forms, you wouldn’t know how to create forms properly from scratch. 

2. Initially, the tutor didn't install some Ruby gems correctly, so you would need to go back to fix some issues there (Took me about 15-20mins to fix them. Would be nice if he could have edited that part of the video. And the similar problems happened for a couple times later.)

3. The tutor didn't explain some code clearly... but probably that’s how Rails magic :sparkles: works? LOL
